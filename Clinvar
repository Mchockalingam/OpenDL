Objective

The objective is to predict whether a ClinVar variant will have conflicting classifications. This is presented here as a binary classification method, where each data in the dataset is a genetic variant.

Conflicting classifications are when two of any of the following three categories are present for one variant.
Likely Benign or Benign
Variant of uncertain significance
Likely Pathogenic or Pathogenic
I have assigned Conflicting classification to the CLASS column. It is a binary representation of whether or not a variant has conflicting classifications, where 0 represents consistent classifications and 1 represents conflicting classifications.

I have removed all the variants from original clinvar since Since this problem only relates to variants with multiple classifications.
